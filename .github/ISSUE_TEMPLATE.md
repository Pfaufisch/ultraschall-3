READ THE FOLLOWING FIRST:

Read the FAQ: https://sendegate.de/c/ultraschall/Ultraschall-frequently-asked-questions

This is a bug and feature tracker, please only use it to report bugs
or request features within Ultraschall and NOT REAPER.

Do not seek support here ("I need help with ...", "I have a
question ..."), that belongs on the community forum at
https://sendegate.de/c/ultraschall, NOT here.

Mark requests with a "[Request]" prefix in the title please. For bug
reports fully fill out the bug reporting template (if you don't know
where to find some information - it's all described in the Contribution
Guidelines linked up there in the big yellow box).

When reporting a bug do NOT delete ANY lines from the template.

Make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the CURRENT
Ultraschall version and that it does not vanish when you upgrade to
the current version of Ultraschall.

Thank you!
